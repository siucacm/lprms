This folder contains the static mockup for the design of the web portal that
this will ultimately house. It should at least provide some idea of the default
theme/template that will ship with the script, plus account for a feature list.

While we want the layout to remain as fluid as possible (with CSS), there has
to be at least some underlying structure in the system, to give developers an
idea of how the portal should look. Then the artsy people can come in and
redesign the look and feel all they want.
